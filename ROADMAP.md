# JRPG Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the logical progression for building core JRPG systems before writing the story.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Movement & World) ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ **Tilemap/Map System** - Render tile-based maps from data (2D arrays or files)
2. ✅ **Sprite System** - Load and render animated sprites
3. ✅ **Player Character** - Basic player entity with position and sprite
4. ✅ **Input & Movement** - 4-directional movement with keyboard/gamepad
5. ✅ **Collision Detection** - Tile-based collision (walls, blocked tiles)
6. ✅ **Camera System** - Follow player, handle screen boundaries

## Phase 2: Core RPG Mechanics ✅ COMPLETED
7. ✅ **Character Stats System** - HP, MP, Attack, Defense, Level, Experience
8. ✅ **Party Management** - Multiple party members, active/reserve parties
9. ✅ **State Machine** - Game states (Exploration, Battle, Menu, Dialog)
10. ✅ **Scene Manager** - Switch between different maps/areas

## Phase 3: Battle System
11. **Battle State Foundation** - Turn-based battle structure
12. **Enemy System** - Enemy stats, AI behaviors, formations
13. **Battle UI** - Command menus (Attack, Magic, Item, Defend, Run)
14. **Combat Math** - Damage calculations, hit/miss, critical hits
15. **Battle Actions** - Implement attack, defend, item use
16. **Victory/Defeat** - EXP/gold rewards, level up, game over

## Phase 4: Progression Systems
17. **Inventory System** - Item storage, equipment slots
18. **Equipment System** - Weapons, armor affecting stats
19. **Magic/Skill System** - Spells, abilities, MP costs
20. **Leveling System** - Experience, stat growth, skill learning

## Phase 5: UI & Interaction
21. **Menu System** - Main menu (Status, Items, Equipment, Save)
22. **Dialog System** - Text boxes, portraits, choices
23. **NPC System** - Interact with NPCs, trigger dialogs
24. **Shop System** - Buy/sell items and equipment

## Phase 6: Persistence & Polish
25. **Save/Load System** - Save game state to disk
26. **Sound Effects** - Battle, menu, movement sounds
27. **Music System** - Background music per area/battle
28. **Transitions** - Screen fades, battle transitions

## Recommended Approach

**Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)** - Everything depends on having a working world to move around in.

**Battle System (Phase 3)** should come before full progression systems since you'll need to test combat math and balancing.

Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a solid foundation for your JRPG.
